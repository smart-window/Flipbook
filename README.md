How to open this project with Unity
-----------------------------------

This repository includes some [submodules]. Before opening the project with
Unity, not only the repository itself but also these submodules have to be
synced up.

If you're using Git from the command line, please run `git submodule init` and
`git submodule update` in the project directory to sync the submodules. Or you
can just use the `--recursive` option when initially cloning the repository.

[submodules]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
